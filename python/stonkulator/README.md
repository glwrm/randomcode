# Stonkulator
Stonkulator is a terminal-based game I made a while ago that uses only keyboard controls (Requires the pynput module). It is a stock-trading game where there are a few stocks to choose from, and you can buy and sell from them. Some are riskier, going up and down rapidly, but some have a steady growth and could make a lot of money if you invest early on. At the start, you choose a difficulty, which can heavily increase stock volatility, make you start with less cash, and reduce the total amount of shares you can buy. Once you reach a certain amount of money, such as $50k or $1 million, you will unlock a new rank, which will allow you to get more shares at once on the same stock. With many advanced controls, big milestones to reach, and something that still feels like an actual game, Stonkulator is by far my best terminal-based game I've ever made.

## Custom Stocks and Difficulties
In the custom_data.json file, you can create custom stocks and difficulties. Make a stock that always grows but super slowly, or make a difficulty that starts you out with only 1 dollar to your name and super high volatility. There are examples already made for you. WARNING: Alignment and readability may break if stock names are too long.
